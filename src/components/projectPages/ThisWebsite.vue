    Site is written in
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a>
    and deployed using
    <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>
    <br><br>
    Both of these are excellent tools for web development.<br>
    I was extremely impressed with the ease of deployment to pages.<br>
    More of my education is based in the backend side of things,<br>
    and I found these tools simple and easy to use.
