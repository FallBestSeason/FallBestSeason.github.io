todo
home screen vertical / low res mode that moves text box under image
should be possible with conditional css class and html vue magic
add more project tiles and blog posts

blog functionality
  probably use markdown to write each post
  then use some library for vue that renders markdown
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-markdown-render

currently throwing errors on blog screen
need to get file in as string, markdown render is working fine
was having trouble importing file into js as node.js libraries are unavailable
figure out how to get fs or use a different method
after that implement router functionality in Blog.vue

reasearch vue router structure and state handling stuff
the existing solution works fine for something of this size 
but adhering to a popular model is probably wise in the long run
